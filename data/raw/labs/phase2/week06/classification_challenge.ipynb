    "Today, you'll work with your pod members to build a machine learning model that will predict if a customer will cancel their phone plan. Your goal is to complete a machine learning pipeline on a novel dataset using the techniques and models that you've learned about throughout Phase 2. Additionally, if your model achieves a higher F1-score than other teams, your team will be awarded additional points on the Kahoot leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team should complete the listed idiomatic steps:\n",
    "1. EDA: Extract quick insights from your dataset using visualizations. Use the insights you've gained to inform your machine learning step.\n",
    "2. Machine learning: Select, train, and find hyperparameters for a 2-3 machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we will not explicitly state which code you should write to accomplish each step, we will ask you to consider the lessons & code-alongs that we've completed over the past couple of weeks to inform your analysis. \n",

    "More details are listed below:\n",

    "You will use a dataset pulled from the following UCI repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset). More information on this dataset can be found at the following link.\n",

    "**Rules**\n",
    "* You must submit your entry before class ends (9:30).  \n",
    "* You're encouraged to use your notes, lecture slides, previous labs, and your peers to strategize and debug.  \n",
    "* This is a chance to apply **everything**: feature engineering, over-sampling, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and non-linear models.  \n",
