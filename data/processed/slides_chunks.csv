unsupervised recommendation algorithm that will recommend users new 
songs based on their previous listening history. As this is a brand new 
project, you will have to build this project from scratch.
Submit a link to your GitHub repository by 4/22."

slide,Transformer Architecture.pdf,19,1,"Almost all of the technology behind this third AI boom has come from the transformer 
architecture! Although originally invented for text, (machine translation) it can be used on

In short, transformers aren't just good at reading, they're good at any problem where the 
model needs to look at a lot of data and decide what's important."

sample - a subset of your population which you collect data from
feature - an important component of your data
independent variable - something that does not change when other features in your data change
dependent variable - a value which changes when other features in your data change
discrete variable - a variable which is measured in whole numbers (think integers)
continuous variable - a variable which is measured with all real numbers, including decimals
categorical variable - something that is describes things (e.g. color, type, class, etc;)
quantitative variable -  something that measures things (e.g. age, height, weight, etc;"
slide,Types of Visualizations Review.pdf,64,2,")
latent variable - a variable that is not directly observable, but can be inferred from other variables that can be 
directly measured"
