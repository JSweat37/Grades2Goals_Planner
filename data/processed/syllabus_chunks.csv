Data Science Syllabus 
 
Class Summary: 
The Knowledge House Data Science Innovation Fellowship aims to provide students with a multifaceted, 
foundational skill set essential for an entry-level data or software specialist role, which includes roles in 
software engineering, data analysis, research analysis,  analytics engineering, and more. 
Commencing with foundational programming skills, emphasis is laid on mastering Python as a versatile 
tool for data ingestion, manipulation, and storage. This also entails an exploration of foundational 
programming skills that students could apply to any language, as well as light forays into individual 
statistics modules. Subse"
syllabus,IF Data Science 2025 Syllabus.pdf,1,2,"quently, students then delve into pandas data manipulation in order to preempt 
the large-scale data analysis and prediction which will be performed in the next phase. 
The curriculum progresses to machine learning, covering supervised and unsupervised learning, 
classification, regression, clustering, and ensemble methods. Practical aspects such as feature engineering, 
model selection, and evaluation metrics are explored, providing a nuanced understanding of the iterative 
nature of the data science process. In tandem, students are also equipped with skills in relational database 
modeling, management, and manipulation using the Structured Query Language (SQL).  
The final phase then concl"
syllabus,IF Data Science 2025 Syllabus.pdf,1,3,"udes with a comprehensive group project which will develop an analysis report or 
software tool that satisfies the work-related needs of the Data Science team. Students will work together 
with their pod members to ensure that tasks are completed in iterative sprint-based chunks along with 
respective stand-ups. 
Ethical considerations in data science, encompassing issues of bias, fairness, privacy, and responsible data 
handling practices, are integrated into the curriculum. Real-world applications and case studies are 
incorporated to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications across various domains, fostering a 
holistic understanding. The program culminates with various cap"

1. Plagiarism: 
●​ Plagiarism, the use of someone else's work or ideas without proper acknowledgment, is a 
serious violation of academic integrity. This includes, but is not limited to, submitting someone 
else's work as your own, copying and pasting from online sources without citation, and 
collaborating on assignments without authorization.  
●​ Coding patterns will be acknowledged and noted that while there may be minimal variance in 
process, the wholesale copying of code from another source without proper attribution still 
constitutes plagiarism.  
2. Responsible Use of AI Tools: 
●​ The use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT and other Lan"

completing assignments or exams unless explicitly authorized by the instructor. Utilizing AI to 
generate responses, essays, or other academic content without proper citation is considered a 
violation of academic integrity. 
●​ If the use of AI tools is permitted for a specific assignment, clear guidelines will be provided by 
the instructor. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in academic penalties. 
3. Collaboration and Individual Work: 
●​ Collaboration is encouraged when explicitly permitted by the instructor. However, individual 
assignments should be completed independently unless instructed otherwise. If uncertain
