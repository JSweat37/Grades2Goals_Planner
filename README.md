# Why Grades2Goals?
Feedback often stops at a score, leaving students unsure how to improve. Grades2Goals closes that gap. It transforms grades into a 7-day plan built around review, practice, and reflection, so your feedback becomes your game plan.

We call it G2G because it’s about showing up, putting in the work, and leveling up. At its core, G2G means turning Grades into Growth.

# Project Overview
Grades2Goals is a learning tool that converts rubric scores, quiz performance, and assignment feedback into personalized 7-day micro-task study plans.

Each plan blends review, practice, and reflection so students know exactly what to focus on and how to grow. With semantic search and embeddings, G2G links feedback directly to course resources like slides, labs, and the syllabus — and extends learning with optional outside practice (LeetCode, Kaggle, or textbook chapters).

This repo walks you through the full pipeline:

- Extracting and chunking course data

- Building embeddings and semantic search

- Generating 7-day plans with linked tasks

- Tracking progress with a database backend

Instead of a grade that ends the story, G2G gives students a roadmap that keeps the story moving from grades into growth.

- In notebook 3.5 Created SQLite-based task management system that allows for plans to created with multiple tasks and track completion progress. Which allows for SQLite tables for plans and task, create named plans with multiple tasks, toggle task completion status, calculate and display completion percentage, shows plans with task status and progress indicators.
- In notebook 4 Created SQLite-based study plan management system that helps students track their learning progress through structured daily tasks. The study plan loads from JSON format with multi-day task organization. It marks individual tasks as complete and tracks progress. It prevents advancement to new days until previous day's tasks are completed. In addition it calculates completion percentages and time estimates. Uses SQLite to store plans, tasks, and completion status
